  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Expensy</p>
  <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: December 1, 2025</p>

  <p>BoringSoft ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use Expensy ("the App").</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Display name, email address, and password when you create an account, or information provided through Sign in with Apple.</li>
    <li><strong>Expense Data:</strong> Amount, category, date, merchant name, and notes for expenses you enter.</li>
    <li><strong>Receipt Images:</strong> Photos of receipts you scan for AI-powered data extraction. These images are stored locally on your device only.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics to collect usage statistics, including app interactions, feature usage, and session data.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash logs and diagnostic data to improve app stability.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device type, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and language settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your information to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and maintain the App's functionality</li>
    <li>Process your expenses and provide AI-powered receipt scanning</li>
    <li>Synchronize your data across devices (when sync is enabled)</li>
    <li>Process subscription payments through Apple</li>
    <li>Improve and optimize the App</li>
    <li>Diagnose technical issues and fix bugs</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Processing</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Local Storage</h3>
  <p>Your expense data is stored locally on your device by default. Receipt images are always stored locally on your device and are never uploaded to our servers, regardless of whether cloud synchronization is enabled.</p>

  <h3>3.2 Cloud Synchronization</h3>
  <p>If you enable sync, only your transaction data (amounts, categories, dates, merchant names, and notes) is uploaded to Supabase servers. This is text data only. Receipt images are never uploaded—they remain exclusively on your device. Supabase provides secure, encrypted cloud storage for your synced transaction data.</p>

  <h3>3.3 AI Receipt Processing</h3>
  <p>When you scan a receipt, the image is sent through our secure backend proxy to Google's Gemini AI service for text extraction. Our backend does not store the images—they are processed and immediately discarded. Google's Gemini API (paid tier) does not use your data to train their AI models. However, data may be temporarily cached by Google for processing purposes and may be logged for abuse monitoring in accordance with Google's policies.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Cloud database for account and expense data synchronization. Privacy: <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">https://supabase.com/privacy</a></li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Usage analytics. Privacy: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> Crash reporting. Privacy: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></li>
    <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Subscription management. Privacy: <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy</a></li>
    <li><strong>Google Gemini AI:</strong> Receipt image processing. Privacy: <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms">https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms</a></li>

  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain your account and expense data for as long as your account is active. Locally stored data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App. If you enable sync, cloud-stored data is retained until you delete your account. When you delete your account, all associated data is permanently removed from our servers within 30 days.</p>

  <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>Your data may be transferred to and processed in countries outside your residence, including the United States. We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, such as Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, to protect your data during such transfers.</p>

  <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not intended for children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have collected data from a child, we will delete it promptly.</p>

  <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated policy within the App and updating the "Effective Date" above. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
